# Simplified and Quick Prototype for Wildfire Risk Assessment

## Core Features of the Prototype

1. **Fixed Grid Over the Study Area:**
   - Use a **fixed grid** with uniform cells across the study area to simplify spatial partitioning and avoid complexities related to random grid generation.
   
2. **Single Image or Time Snapshot:**
   - Instead of working with a time series of images, start with a single image to estimate vegetation density (VD), moisture levels (M), and elevation (E) for each grid cell.

3. **Basic Fire Risk Function:**
   - Use a simple, predefined model that relates the estimated VD, M, and E to fire risk. This function can be basic and approximate but will provide you with a functional prototype.

4. **Monte Carlo Simulation with Fixed Distributions:**
   - Run a Monte Carlo simulation to generate random samples of VD and M for each grid cell, assuming a normal distribution for each variable based on the single image data. Use these samples to compute fire risk for each cell.

5. **Heatmap Visualization:**
   - Produce a basic heatmap that visualizes the computed fire risk for each cell in the grid.

## Steps to Build the Simplified Prototype

### 1. Data Collection (Single Image)
   - **Acquire a single image** (e.g., from satellite or drone data) covering the region of interest.
   - **Estimate Vegetation Density (VD) and Moisture Levels (M):**
     - Use basic ML models (e.g., a pretrained CNN) or simple thresholding techniques to estimate vegetation density and moisture levels.
   - **Obtain Elevation Data (E):**
     - Download a **Digital Elevation Model (DEM)** for your region to use elevation data for each cell.

### 2. Create a Fixed Grid
   - Define a **uniform grid** over the study area, dividing it into a regular set of cells (e.g., 100x100 cells, depending on the size of the area and the resolution of the data).
   - Assign each cell a **single value** for VD, M, and E based on the image and elevation data.

### 3. Simple Fire Risk Model
   - Use a simple fire risk function to calculate fire probability for each cell. For instance:
     \[
     P_{\text{fire}} = \frac{VD}{M + 1} \cdot \exp(E / 1000)
     \]
   - This function assumes higher vegetation density and lower moisture increase fire risk, while elevation plays a minor role.

### 4. Monte Carlo Simulation
   - For each grid cell, simulate \( N \) trials (e.g., 1,000) using random samples from the normal distributions of VD and M.
   - **Steps for Each Trial:**
     1. Randomly sample values for VD and M from their respective distributions.
     2. Use the fire risk function to calculate the fire probability for that trial.
     3. Record the probability for each trial.

   - After \( N \) trials, **average the fire probabilities** for each cell to obtain the overall fire risk.

### 5. Visualize Fire Risk
   - Generate a **basic heatmap** showing the average fire risk for each grid cell. Use a color gradient (e.g., green for low risk, red for high risk) to visualize the results.

## Tools and Libraries to Use

- **Data Handling:**
  - Use **pandas** and **numpy** to store and manipulate the grid and Monte Carlo results.
- **Geospatial Processing:**
  - Use **GDAL** or **Rasterio** for handling geospatial data such as elevation and images.
- **Visualization:**
  - Use **Matplotlib** or **Plotly** for creating heatmaps.
  - **Folium** or **Leaflet** can be used later for more interactive map visualizations.

## Scaling the Prototype

Once this prototype is working, you can begin adding more complex features:
1. **Multiple Images (Time Series):** Expand the data input to a time series of images to track changes in VD and M over time.
2. **Random Grid Construction:** Instead of using a fixed grid, implement random grid generation using a Monte Carlo-like approach.
3. **Dynamic Fire Risk Models:** Refine the fire risk function with more complex models based on empirical data or simulations.
4. **Adaptive Granularity:** Incorporate multi-scale grid granularity to capture both local and regional effects.

## Conclusion

This simplified prototype gives you a working model that demonstrates the core concepts: grid partitioning, Monte Carlo simulations, and fire risk assessment. Itâ€™s quick to set up, and once it's functional, you can incrementally add more advanced features such as random grid generation, multi-scale analysis, and complex fire risk functions.
